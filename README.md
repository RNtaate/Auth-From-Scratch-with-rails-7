# Rails Authentication from Scratch

## Project Description

> This project is a simple standard `User` authentication system built from scratch in `Ruby on Rails`.

> It was built to better understand the workings and what goes on under the hood when one uses an authentication generative engine like **Devise** in a `Ruby on Rails` project.

> It portrays a few functionalities such as **Sign up**, **Sign In**, and **Log Out** functionalities, authorization and restrication to access certain pages if not `logged in` or after `loggin in`.
